## What the Application Will Do

The application is a web-based 2D online game with a top-down view, in which players can move through an infinite panel apartment building, communicate with each other, and manage their own apartment. A player can enter individual apartments (if they are not locked), lock their own apartment, travel between floors using an elevator, and customize the appearance of both the player and the apartment using preset options.

The application also includes a chat system where messages appear above the sender’s character and are filtered for inappropriate words. An administrator has the ability to manage users and the application’s content.

## Target Audience

The application is primarily intended for younger and older players who are interested in simple online social games, communication with other players, and a virtual environment similar to a community apartment building. It can also be used in school projects or as a demonstration of a web-based multiplayer application.
